Scraper:
    ☐ Divide paints into categories
    ☐ Investigate other paint providers and how to scrape them
    ☐ Way of moving all the images and data from the scraped folders to the front end project

Frontend: 
    Main goals: 
        ☐ Learn about hooks https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html @started(20-08-25 19:25)
        ✔ Select a colour and be shown the complimentary colour @started(20-08-25 20:07) @done(20-08-30 18:06) @lasted(4d21h59m54s)
            ✘ You can use css filters with invert() to do it super easy, but that doesn't let me learn about colour maths @cancelled(20-08-30 18:06)
            ✘ I've tried doing some wrap around maths on the rgb values which does change the values but it looks wrong @cancelled(20-08-30 18:06)
        ✔ List the scraped paints, click one, show complimentary colours @done(20-08-30 18:07)
            - It currently lists a subset for development
        ✔ Select a paint and then display the hex code elsewhere @done(20-08-25 19:26)

        Stretch goals:
            ☐ Dark mode support? @started(20-08-30 18:07)
            ☐ When selecting a paint show the user the paint that is nearest to the complimentary colour

    ✘ Better folder structure, the default of CRA isn't nice @cancelled(20-08-30 21:17)
        Leave it as is, so the gh-pages deploy works flawlessly
    ☐ Replace SVG images with something nicer. Border, bottom area coloured?
    ☐ Create buttons for filtering
    ☐ Search box for paint names
    ☐ Bring in more data
