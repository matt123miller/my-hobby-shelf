            - You can use css filters with invert() to do it super easy, but that doesn't let me learn about colour maths
            - I've tried doing some wrap around maths on the rgb values which does change the values but it looks wrong 
        ☐ List the scraped paints, click one, show complimentary colours
        ✔ Select a paint and then display the hex code elsewhere @done(20-08-25 19:26)
