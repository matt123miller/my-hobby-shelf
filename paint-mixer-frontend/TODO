Scraper:
    ☐ Divide paints into categories
    ☐ Investigate other paint providers and how to scrape them
    ☐ Way of moving all the images and data from the scraped folders to the front end project

Frontend: 
    Main goals: 
        ☐ Blurb explaining the theory
            - RGB Additive colour model etc.  
        ☐ Learn about hooks https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html @started(20-08-25 19:25)
        ✔ Select a colour and be shown the complimentary colour @started(20-08-25 20:07) @done(20-08-30 18:06) @lasted(4d21h59m54s)
            ✘ You can use css filters with invert() to do it super easy, but that doesn't let me learn about colour maths @cancelled(20-08-30 18:06)
            ✘ I've tried doing some wrap around maths on the rgb values which does change the values but it looks wrong @cancelled(20-08-30 18:06)
        ✔ List the scraped paints, click one, show complimentary colours @done(20-08-30 18:07)
            - It currently lists a subset for development
        ✔ Select a paint and then display the hex code elsewhere @done(20-08-25 19:26)
        ☐ Keyboard accessible
        ✔ Dark mode support? @started(20-08-30 18:07) @done(20-09-16 22:47) @lasted(2w3d4h40m57s)

        Stretch goals:
            ☐ When selecting a paint show the user the paint that is nearest to the complimentary colour
            ☐ Reactive dark mode system that also respects users OS choice as the default

    ✘ Better folder structure, the default of CRA isn't nice @cancelled(20-08-30 21:17)
        - Leave it as is, so the gh-pages deploy works flawlessly
    ✔ Replace SVG images with something nicer. Border, bottom area coloured? @done(20-08-30 21:46)
        - good first pass
    ☐ Create buttons for filtering @started(20-09-16 22:47)
    ✔ Create buttons for alphabetical sorting @done(20-08-30 23:21)
    ✔ Search box for paint names @done(20-09-01 19:58)
        ☐ Style it @started(20-08-31 00:02)
        ✘  Style should resepect dark/light mode @cancelled(20-09-16 22:47)
        ✔ It should actually search @done(20-09-01 20:00)
    ☐ Buttons for sorting colours black to white, white to black (sort on hex code) @started(20-09-16 22:47)
    ✔ Bring in more data @started(20-08-30 21:47) @done(20-08-30 21:52) @lasted(5m17s)
    ☐ More convincing header section
        ☐ Colour boxes for chosen and complimentary @started(20-09-01 19:59)
        ✔ Gradient between 2 colours @started(20-09-01 19:59) @done(20-09-01 19:59) @lasted(48s)
    ✔ maake sure transition doesn't happen on page load @done(20-09-16 21:48)


    ☐ Implement better colour sorting next time. Notes: 
    
sorting dark to light / light to dark

darkest is black
#000000 or RGB(255, 255, 255)

lightest is white
#ffffff or RGB( 0, 0, 0)

red
#ff0000 255, 0, 0

blue
#0000ff 0, 0, 255

both are the same total hue



if we sum the rgb values (ranges from 0 to 765) and sort by that value
