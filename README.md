# paint-mixer-app

## [View a WIP version here](https://matt123miller.github.io/paint-mixer-app/).


There's 2 folders.

- 1 for scraping websites to get info about the paints.
- 1 for the front end site that uses that scraped info.

I wanted a little tool for helping me when miniature painting. Something that could suggest complimentary colours.

You can see my to do list [here](./paint-mixer-frontend/TODO). I use the excellent [TODO+](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-todo-plus) extension to keep track.

## Installation

There are 2 npm projects in here though both are the same.

- `cd` into either directory
