# paint-mixer-app

## [View a WIP version here](https://matt123miller.github.io/paint-mixer-app/).

There's 2 folders.

- [scraping](./scraping/README.md) for scraping websites to get info about the paints.
- [paint-mixer-frontend](./paint-mixer-frontend/README.md) for the front end site that uses that scraped info.

I wanted a little tool for helping me when miniature painting. Something that could suggest complimentary colours.

## Installation

There are 2 npm projects in here though both are the same.

- `cd` into either directory
- `npm install`
